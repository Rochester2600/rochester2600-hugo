    title : What is 2600?
    description : >
            2600 is a reference to 2600: Hacker Quarterly. A periodical that's been around since the 80's. We host our meetings on the first Friday of every month because that's when all 2600 meetings should be hosted. We don't have any official relationship with the org, it's just a platform to gather around.

    title : What to expect
    description : >
            If you've never attended a meeting, we are generally loosely organized. We present on the latest security news of the month and usually follow it with at least one presentations from one of our attendees. Expect to laugh and interact with the rest of the group. Bring a laptop if you wish but it's usually unnecessary.
