**Where is 2600 located?**

It changes month to month. Check on the Meetup page and/or Twitter for the latest info. 

**Why are meetings on the First Friday?**

This is the only law of 2600 meetings. In the 80's meetings were setup to run at the exact same
time world-wide so that everyone could dial into a single party line and join a huge meeting. 
As groups expanded this rule has become relaxed. 

We often think about changing the times but then some famous hacker shows up because they knew that
meetings happened at this time and we decide not to. 

**Do you serve food and alcohol?**

Sometimes. It depends on where we're meeting. Generally drinks are not frowned upon during meetings. 

**Should I attend?**

Look if you're reading this content this far and it's still a question, obviously yes. You're interested
in what we're about, we try to be friendly, and we like meeting new people. 

**Should I bring a laptop?**

Yes. We offer free wifi through Interlock. Some of the presentations may be hands-on so having a system is a plus.  

**What's BSidesROC?**

[BSidesROC](http://www.bsidesroc.com) or Security B-Sides Rochester, is a yearly hackercon that the folks at 2600 and the local hacker community throw every year. It is always free and open to the public and aims to share knowledge about security and the hacker community. Check out their website for more information or come to a 2600 meeting and ask.
