The current organizers of Rochester 2600 started in 2009. At the time we were meeting at 
Panera Bread in Webster. The organizer was being harassed by the local police and lamented 
that he had no alternative but to move to another state. So he did. 

We took it over from him with the intent to keep it going and also get more people involved 
in meetings. A decade later, we've spawned some really interested groups like BSidesROC and 
Interlock Rochester. 

In the early 2000's, Rochester 2600 was meeting at food courts in the mall.
