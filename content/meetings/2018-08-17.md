Join us this month for a hilarious examination of George Bush throughout
our meditation on the effects ridilin has on power hungry dwarves and
Penfield . These are actually the talks we have scheduled:

* All: This month in infosec
* AntiTree: Securing a Secure Secure Shell
* Geo4a: Spinning Up OSQuery in AWS
