Warning: For the first month ever, Rochester 2600 is doing a non-sarcastic
blog post. 

This coming month's meeting is Pee Edition in memoriam to
our good friend [Paul (PEE) who passed away in the previous month](https://www.murphyfuneralservices.com/notices/Paul-Erkkila). 
Pee had been involved with 2600, Interlock, Security B-Sides Rochester
and tons of other groups but mostly just a friend to all. 

We're still holding an open meeting. Please join. We'll go through
the monthly infosec news and try to make the same sarcastic comments
that he would have. 

* All: This month in infosec news
