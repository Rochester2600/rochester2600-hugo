Attending a 2600 meeting this month means you will see a deep dive into
Dick Cheney as we complain about a sumo wrestle match between
pseudoscience and a primary school teacher . Gah. Whatever. Talks below:

* All: This month in infosec news
* No other presentations while we're at Hacker Summercamp
