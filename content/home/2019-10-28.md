Join us this Friday for the last ever 2600 meeting to be held
at Interlock Rochester at the hungerford. This space has 
served us for more than a decade and its time is up. 

Join us for one last night where we share stories and pictures
and talk about the future of a space and 2600. 

* All: This month in infosec news
* Antitree: The complete list of all the terrible things that we've done at the space with pictures.
